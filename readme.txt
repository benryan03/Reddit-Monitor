Reddit Monitor
https://github.com/benryan03/Reddit-Monitor

Reddit Monitor shows a continuously refreshing feed of the newest images 
posted to Reddit.

Every second, the newest image will be fetched, along with its title and 
subreddit.

Data about each image shown is logged in log.txt in the same directory as the 
executable.

This project uses the HTML Agility Pack module to scrape data from Reddit.
